<li><strong>Licensee Grant.</strong> Upon full execution of this Agreement, Licensee agrees to grant a worldwide, nonexclusive license and/or sublicense (commensurate to the scope of the licenses which Licensee has selected hereunder) under any and all AVC Essential Patent(s) that Licensee and its Affiliates, if any, have the right to license and/or sublicense, to any Licensor or any sublicensee of the Licensing Administrator desiring such a license and/or sublicense on fair and reasonable terms and conditions. For purposes of this Section 8.3 only, the Licensors' per patent share of royalties which are payable pursuant to Article 3 of this Agreement shall be presumed to be a fair and reasonable royalty rate for the aforementioned license and/or sublicense to be granted by the Licensee.</li>
<li><strong>Licensee's Option.</strong> In lieu of Section 8.3, Licensee shall have the option to hereby grant a worldwide, nonexclusive, nontransferable, except to a successor Licensing Administrator, license and/or sublicense under any and all of its AVC Essential Patent(s) to the Licensing Administrator with the right by the Licensing Administrator to grant AVC Patent Portfolio Licenses that include the AVC Essential Patent(s) that Licensee and its Affiliates, if any, have the right to license or sublicense. Licensee shall identify to the Licensors any and all of its Patents which Licensee believes in good faith to be an AVC Essential Patent(s). Licensors shall determine whether each of the patent(s) identified by Licensee is an AVC Essential Patent(s) according to an established procedure applicable to all new Patents identified to the Licensors. The terms and conditions of the license and/or sublicense granted by the Licensee to the Licensing Administrator under this Section 8.4 shall be identical to the terms and conditions of the license and/or sublicense granted by each Licensor to the Licensing Administrator. If Licensee elects the option set forth in this Section 8.4, it shall enter into an agreement referred to as the "Agreement Among Licensors," and other associated agreements which have been entered into by all Licensors.</li>
<li><strong>Licensee Covenants.</strong>
<ol>
<li>Licensee hereby covenants to promptly notify the Licensing Administrator in the event that any allowed patent application(s) published for opposition, which is licensed or sublicensed to the Licensing Administrator pursuant to Section 8.4 of this Agreement as an AVC Essential Patent(s), does not issue as an AVC Essential Patent(s).</li>
<li>Licensee shall promptly identify to the Licensing Administrator each patent(s), except for AVC Patent Portfolio Patents of the Licensors, licensable or sublicensable by Licensee, which Licensee believes in good faith to be an AVC Essential Patent(s) within thirty (30) days of execution of this Agreement.</li>
<li>In the event that Licensee or any of its Affiliates has granted an exclusive license to a third party under an AVC Essential Patent(s) prior to the date of Licensee's execution of this Agreement, Licensee shall advise the Licensing Administrator of such an exclusive license and identify to the Licensing Administrator such third party.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Licensing Administrator Covenants.</strong>

<li>The Licensing Administrator covenants that if during the term of this Agreement it acquires rights to grant sublicenses under additional AVC Essential Patent(s), the AVC Patent Portfolio License herein will be supplemented to include such additional AVC Essential Patent(s).</li>
<li>The Licensing Administrator covenants that, with the exception of partial termination under Section 6.3 of this Agreement, any deletion from the AVC Patent Portfolio shall occur only upon a determination by the Licensors, or upon a final adjudication of a tribunal of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal is taken or allowed, that the deleted Patent(s) is invalid or unenforceable in the country which issued or published the Patent(s), and that any addition to the AVC Patent Portfolio shall occur only upon the determination by the Licensors that the additional Patent(s) is an AVC Essential Patent(s) in the country which issued or published the Patent(s).</li>
<li>The Licensing Administrator farther covenants that if any Patent(s) in the AVC Patent Portfolio sublicensed by the Licensing Administrator to Licensee pursuant to the terms hereof is found not to be an AVC Essential Patent(s) in the country which issued or published the Patent(s), either by the Licensors or upon a final adjudication of a tribunal of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal is taken or allowed, and such Patent(s) which is licensed to Licensee is to be deleted from the AVC Patent Portfolio, the Licensing Administrator shall give notice to Licensee of such deletion, and Licensee shall have the option to retain its sublicense under the deleted Patent(s) for the remainder of the term of this Agreement, including any renewal pursuant to Section 6.1 hereunder.</li>

Licensee shall be entitled to an amendment of this Agreement to the extent of providing for royalty rates as favorable as that available to such other party within thirty (30) days of sending written notice to the Licensing Administrator requesting such amendment; provided, however, that this Agreement shall also be amended to include any additional terms provided in connection with the more favorable royalty rate as specified by the Licensing Administrator. Any amendment made pursuant to this Section 8.7 shall be effective as of the date it is made, and such more favorable royalty rates shall not be retroactively applicable in favor of the Licensee, and shall not be a basis for claiming any refund of royalties paid or accrued prior to such effective date.
